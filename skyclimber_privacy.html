    <b>Personal Information</b>
    <br />
    None of your personal information is collected. When you open the app for the first time, a randomly generated code is created within the app. This code is paired with your in-game name to authenticate changes made to your highscore on the leaderboard. When you obtain a highscore, your highscore, in-game name, and authentication code are sent to a dreamlo leaderboard. The in-game leaderboard displays this information except for the code.

In order to do this, AdMob uses a resettable Advertising ID which is unique to you and is provided by Google Play services. No data collected is linked to your identity.
