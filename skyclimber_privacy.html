    WarpiWare built the Sky Climber app as a Freemium app. This SERVICE is provided by WarpiWare at no cost and is intended for use as is.

    This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
    
    If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
    
    Personal Information
    None of your personal information is collected. When you open the app for the first time, a randomly generated code is created within the app. This code is paired with your in-game name to authenticate changes made to your highscore on the leaderboard. When you obtain a highscore, your highscore, in-game name, and authentication code are sent to a dreamlo leaderboard. The in-game leaderboard displays this information except for the code.
    
    Advertising
    All ads in the app are served by the AdMob network. AdMob may collect anonymous data in order to deliver customized ads to this app as well as to other apps and websites. In order to do this, AdMob uses a resettable Advertising ID which is unique to you and is provided by Google Play services. No data collected is linked to your identity. To learn more about AdMob's privacy policies, see Google's privacy policy.
